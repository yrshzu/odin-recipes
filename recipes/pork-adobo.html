    <h1>Pork Adobo</h1>
    <img src="https://panlasangpinoy.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Best-Pork-Adobo-Recipe.jpg" alt="Pork adobo in the table">
    <p> 
        The word Adobo was derived from the Spanish word “adobar”. It means to marinate. 
        This can be in the form of a liquid marinade or to rub using a combination of powdered ingredient.
    </p>
    <p>
        This version of Filipino Adobo suggests marinating the pork in soy sauce and crushed garlic. 
        By preference, vinegar can also be added as a marinade ingredient.

        <strong>Pork and Chicken Adobo</strong> is perhaps one of the favorite when it comes to family picnics. This is a dish wherein pork and chicken slices are combined and cooked inadobo style. It can be done the same way as this recipe, with or without onions. This is our clans signature summer dish in the Philippines. I remember my tito’s and tita’s prepare a large portion every summer outing. 
        <br>We would go to Pansol in Laguna to rent a swimming pool for the clan and they would bring with them two large cauldrons (kaldero). One has the adobo in it, while the other is for the rice.
